# ERC-20 Challenge

Instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_NwigyiFWRBrdFuNx5m6PCtDWZT1IsxpkS9k59yIFo/edit?usp=sharing

# Plagerism 

**You are not permitted to use any existing ERC-20 contracts as a reference.** This includes tutorials and articles.

These contracts will be readily available online to view, **don't be tempted!** We are testing your knowledge here, not your ability to copy. Remember, you are responsible for your own learning. Using other people's code only hurts yourself.

You are allowed to use any ethereum documentation necessary.

# Tests

We have provided some base tests to help aid you in development (see commands below). We will test your contract with additional tests after you submit, your grade will be based on these additional tests. You are strongly encouraged to write your own tests to ensure the contract works.

# Commands

- `npm run style` - Automatically format your contract according to our style guidelines
- `npm run compile` - Compile your contract with truffle
- `npm run migrate` - Deploy your contract locally to ganache
- `npm run test` - Run our pre-made tests on your contract
